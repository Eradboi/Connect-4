## Requirements
The game requires the following Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):
```
pygame
pyvidplayer2
```
Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note that the intro video at the beginning of the game was implemented using pyvidplayer.
Although not having it's dependencies will skip the video, and continue to the game, I would recommend checking it out [here](https://github.com/anrayliu/pyvidplayer2) to install the dependencies e.g `ffmpeg`.
